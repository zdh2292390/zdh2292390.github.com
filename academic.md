<ul>
<a href='https://github.com/zdh2292390/ParTrans-X'>ParTrans-X: An efficient parallel lib for translating embedding algorithms. </a>
The main adavantage of our lib is that our algorithms are totally lock-free multithreading, which enables the algorithms to be highly efficient, and we give some theoretical guarantees in our paper.
Up to now, we implemented the parallel version of TransE, AdagradTransE, and TransH. Named ParTransE, ParAdagradTransE, ParTransH respectively.

The project aimed to make a GUI web tool for data scientists to make workflows of all kinds of machine learning and data mining algorithms fast and easily.<br>
My Work : <li>Implemented various machine learning and preprocess algorithms in spark. </li>
<li>Optimized the IO cost and storage cost of the workflow using parquet.</li>
<li>Implemented GBDT algorithm in spark and optimized it to run faster than MLlib.</li>
</ul>
