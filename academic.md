<b>Knowledge Graph Computation Platform for Video Field</b><br>
Advisor: Jia Yantao, Wang Yuanzhuo, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (cooperate with Huawei Inc.)<br>
This project aims to construct a knowledge graph for videos, including movies, series, carton, etc. Furthermore, the knowledge graph can be enriched automatically from different data source, and supports a plenty of applications such like relation extraction, relation prediction.<br>
My work 1:
<li>Analyzed the parallel methods, including Hogwild!, DistBelief, etc., for the sake of accelerating the supported computation modules.</li>
<li>Proposed and verified the feasibility of lock free strategy in training knowledge graph embedding in parallel.</li>
<li>Paralleled the computation modules that are based on knowledge graph embedding, including entity alignment, relation extraction and tag inference.</li>
My work 2:
<li>Proposed to explore the rich information of hierarchical structures in knowledge graph to promote the relation prediction performance. </li>
<!-- <li>proved the convergence of the proposed method.</li> -->
<li>Experimented the strategy of integrating hierarchical structures on three data sets, and demonstrate the superiority of proposed method.</li>
</ul>

<b>Big Data Analysis Platform</b><br>
Advisor: Lei Cao, Jun Xu, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences<br>
The project aimed to make a GUI web tool for data scientists to make workflows of all kinds of machine learning and data mining algorithms fast and easily.<br>
My Work : <!-- <li>Implemented various machine learning and preprocess algorithms in spark. </li> -->
<li>Implemented GBDT algorithm in Spark and optimized it to run faster than MLlib.</li>
<li>Optimized the IO cost and storage cost of the workflow using parquet.</li>
</ul>

<b>CCF BDCI Agricultural Products Predict Contest</b><br>
This contest aimed to predict the future price of certain agricultural products in China, using the history price data. I used GBDT(Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) Model and Random Forest for ensemble, proposed a loss optimal function for the problem and got a great promotion in accuracy.<br>
My work:
<li>Feature engineering</li>
<li>Loss function design</li>
</ul>

<b>AliBaba Tianchi BigData: CaiNiao Supply Chain Predict Contest</b><br>
This contest aimed to predict the future sales of certain products in TaoBao, using the history sales data and user behavior data. I used GBDT(Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) Model, analyzed the target cost fucntion, then modified the loss function of the GBDT model and got a great promotion in accuracy.<br>
My work:
<li>Feature engineering</li>
<li>Loss function implementation</li>
<li>Implemented GBDT algorithm using Java in MapReduce framework to make it run in AliBabaâ€™s bigdata platform ODPS.</li>
